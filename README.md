### The challenge:

App for junior front end developers to master common coding interview questions via flash cards.

### Process

- Create draft of README file
- Create .gitignore file
- Create Github repository
- Work on HTML, CSS and JS files
- Check final code and accessibility
- Finalize README file
- Publish live URL

### So far the app includes...

- Listen for click on button to pull question from data.js
- Display question on front
- When user hovers on question, flip card to answer on back
- The card should be big enough to hold the questions and answers
- Make sure the contrast is ok

### Would like to add or change...

- Need a start page
- Add more questions and double-check all answers
- Include a reset button
- Include a navigation to show what the game is about...
- Include button to filter questions between React, JS, CSS and HTML
- If a question has already been asked don't show again.
- If the question was hard, then show it again to enhance memorization
- Consider building the app in React instead

### Issues

- Currently, the user can only flip from question to answer on iphones and ipads. I need to make sure that user can flip back from answer to question.
